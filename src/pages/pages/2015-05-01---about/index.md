Heyo. I'm Shane. I like to make things using computer code, and I like to break things using the limitations of the human brain. I also like coffee, beer, rock climbing, lizards, and dark themes.

_"But how do I interact with you?"_ You might ask -- You can [Tweet at me (I don't bite)](https://twitter.com/zeevosec) or follow me on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/zeevosec) for pictures of food and lizards. I also am around on Discord _zeevo#0572_.

Here's a picture of Kalameet the bearded dragon.
